# Mini Raft KV â€” Production-Grade Distributed Consensus

A strongly-consistent, fault-tolerant key-value store implementing the Raft consensus algorithm in Rust.

## Features
- Raft Consensus: Leader election, log replication, safety guarantees
- Strong Consistency: Linearizable reads and writes
- Persistence: Write-Ahead Log + Snapshotting
- Distributed Locks: Mutex primitives with TTL
- Compare-and-Swap: Atomic transactions

## Quick Start
Coming soon - full implementation in progress
